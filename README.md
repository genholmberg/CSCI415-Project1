# Block Encryption/Decryption in RSA

This program to implements and demonstrates the components of the RSA cryptographic algorithm.  The goals included using relatively large prime numbers for the generation and calculation of the keys, computing multiplicative inverses, doing modulo arithmetic, as well as performing encryption on plaintexts and decryption on ciphertexts in multiple steps.  An implementation of the BigInteger C++ class was used to easily perform arithmetic operations on such large numbers, as well as to calculate multiplicative inverses and modular arithmetic.

To use the program, entered the plaintext which will be encrypted into the input text file and use the make  file to compile the program and run the main executable. The encrypted text file will hold the ciphertext and the output text file will hold the decrypted text (same as the input file).

This project was created for a computer security class at St. Cloud State University in collaborations with Michael Miller, Nathan Reichert, and Sean Anderson.
